Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of this multifaceted translation component in cancer. In this review, we briefly discuss the role of {XBP}1 mediators in the {UPR} and the transcriptional function of {XBP}1. In addition, we describe how {XBP}1 operates as a key factor in tumour progression and metastasis. We mainly review {XBP}1's expression, function and prognostic value in research on solid tumours. Finally, we discuss multiple approaches, especially those involving {XBP}1, that overcome the immunosuppressive effect of the {UPR} in cancer that could potentially be useful as antitumour therapies.},

	abstract = {The West Nile virus minus-strand 3' terminal stem loop ({SL}) {RNA} was previously shown to bind specifically to cellular stress granule ({SG}) components, T cell intracellular antigen-1 ({TIA}-1) and the related protein {TIAR}. In vitro {TIAR} binding was 10 times more efficient than {TIA}-1. The 3'(-){SL} functions as the promoter for genomic {RNA} synthesis. Colocalization of {TIAR} and {TIA}-1 with the viral replication complex components {dsRNA} and {NS}3 was observed in the perinuclear regions of West Nile virus- and dengue virus-infected cells. The kinetics of accumulation of {TIAR} in the perinuclear region was similar to those of genomic {RNA} synthesis. In contrast, relocation of {TIA}-1 to the perinuclear region began only after maximal levels of {RNA} synthesis had been achieved, except when {TIAR} was absent. Virus infection did not induce {SGs} and progressive resistance to {SG} induction by arsenite developed coincident with {TIAR} relocation. A progressive decrease in the number of processing bodies was secondarily observed in infected cells. These data suggest that the interaction of {TIAR} with viral components facilitates flavivirus genome {RNA} synthesis and inhibits {SG} formation, which prevents the shutoff of host translation.},

          Gene set enrichment analysis ({GSEA}) is an ubiquitously used tool for evaluating pathway enrichment in transcriptional data. Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked {GSEA} performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure.
          
            Here we present {FGSEA} (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low {GSEA} P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for {GSEA} P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that {FGSEA} is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10
            −100
            with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate {FGSEA} on a collection of 605 datasets and show that {FGSEA} recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations.
          
          
            {FGSEA} is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor (

	abstract = {Abstract
            Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature.
            Results: We present {featureCounts}, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either {RNA} or genomic {DNA} sequencing experiments. {featureCounts} implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications.
            Availability and implementation:   {featureCounts} is available under {GNU} General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.

In this review, our attention is paid to metallothioneins ({MTs}) as small, cysteine-rich and heavy  metal-binding proteins, which participate in an array of protective stress responses. The mechanism of the reaction of metallothioneins with oxidants and electrophilic compounds is discussed. Numerous reports indicate that {MT} protects cells from exposure to oxidants and electrophiles, which react readily with sulfhydryl groups. Moreover, {MT} plays a key role in regulation of zinc levels and distribution in the intracellular space. The connections between zinc, {MT} and cancer are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            p53 controls the cellular response to genotoxic stress through multiple mechanisms. We report here that p53 regulates {DUSP}1, a dual-specific threonine and tyrosine phosphatase with stringent substrate specificity for mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}). {DUSP}1 is a potent inhibitor of {MAPK} activity through dephosphorylation of {MAPK}. In a colon cancer cell line containing inducible ectopic p53, {DUSP}1 protein level is significantly increased upon activation of p53, leading to cell death in response to nutritional stress. In mouse embryo fibroblast cells, {DUSP}1 protein abundance is greatly increased after oxidative stress in a p53-dependent manner and also when apoptosis is triggered. We show that p53 induces the activity of a human {DUSP}1 regulatory region. Furthermore, p53 can physically interact with the {DUSP}1 regulatory region in vivo, and p53 binds to a 10-bp perfect palindromic site in this {DUSP}1 regulatory region. We show that overexpression of {DUSP}1 or inhibition of {MAPK} activity significantly increases cellular susceptibility to oxidative damage. These findings indicate that p53 is a transcriptional regulator of {DUSP}1 in stress responses. Our results reveal a mechanism whereby p53 selectively regulates target genes and suggest a way in which subgroups of those target genes might be controlled independently.

            Mitochondria participate in a wide range of cellular processes. One essential function of mitochondria is to be a platform for antiviral signaling proteins during the innate immune response to viral infection. Recently, studies have revealed that mitochondrion-derived {DNAs} and {RNAs} are recognized as non-self molecules and act as immunogenic ligands. More importantly, the cytosolic release of these mitochondrial nucleic acids (mt-{NAs}) is closely associated with the pathogenesis of human diseases accompanying aberrant immune activation. The release of mitochondrial {DNAs} ({mtDNAs}) via {BAX}/{BAK} activation and/or {VDAC}1 oligomerization activates the innate immune response and inflammasome assembly. In addition, mitochondrial double-stranded {RNAs} (mt-{dsRNAs}) are sensed by pattern recognition receptors in the cytosol to induce type I interferon expression and initiate apoptotic programs. Notably, these cytosolic mt-{NAs} also mediate adipocyte differentiation and contribute to mitogenesis and mitochondrial thermogenesis. In this review, we summarize recent studies of innate immune signaling pathways regulated by mt-{NAs}, human diseases associated with mt-{NAs}, and the emerging physiological roles of mt-{NAs}.},

Global translation is regulated through the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2α ({eIF}2α) and the {mTOR} pathway. Here we identify cold shock as a novel trigger of {SG} assembly in yeast and mammals. Whereas cold shock–induced {SGs} take hours to form, they dissolve within minutes when cells are returned to optimal growth temperatures. Cold shock causes {eIF}2α phosphorylation through the kinase {PERK} in mammalian cells, yet this pathway is not alone responsible for translation arrest and {SG} formation. In addition, cold shock leads to reduced mitochondrial function, energy depletion, concomitant activation of {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}), and inhibition of {mTOR} signaling. Compound C, a pharmacological inhibitor of {AMPK}, prevents the formation of {SGs} and strongly reduces cellular survival in a translation-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that cells actively suppress protein synthesis by parallel pathways, which induce {SG} formation and ensure cellular survival during hypothermia.},

Dynamic {RNA} subcellular localizations are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis; however, their distribution and changes during development and differentiation remain largely unexplored. To elucidate the dynamic patterns of {RNA} distribution within cells, we have upgraded {RNALocate} to version 3.0, a repository for {RNA}-subcellular localization (http://www.rnalocate.org/ or http://www.rna-society.org/rnalocate/). {RNALocate} v3.0 incorporates and analyzes {RNA} subcellular localization sequencing data from over 850 samples, with a specific focus on the dynamic changes in subcellular localizations under various conditions. The species coverage has also been expanded to encompass mammals, non-mammals, plants and microbes. Additionally, we provide an integrated prediction algorithm for the subcellular localization of seven {RNA} types across eleven subcellular compartments, utilizing convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) and transformer models. Overall, {RNALocate} v3.0 contains a total of 1 844 013 {RNA}-localization entries covering 26 {RNA} types, 242 species and 177 subcellular localizations. It serves as a comprehensive and readily accessible data resource for {RNA}-subcellular localization, facilitating the elucidation of cellular function and disease pathogenesis.},

          Neurodegenerative diseases are linked with dysregulation of the integrated stress response ({ISR}), which coordinates cellular homeostasis during and after stress events. Cellular stress can arise from several sources, but there is significant disagreement about which stress might contribute to aging and neurodegeneration. Here, we leverage directed transdifferentiation of human fibroblasts into aged neurons to determine the source of {ISR} activation. We demonstrate that increased accumulation of cytoplasmic double-stranded {RNA} ({dsRNA}) activates the {eIF}2α kinase {PKR}, which in turn triggers the {ISR} in aged neurons and leads to sequestration of {dsRNA} in stress granules. Aged neurons accumulate endogenous mitochondria-derived {dsRNA} that directly binds to {PKR}. This mitochondrial {dsRNA} leaks through damaged mitochondrial membranes and forms cytoplasmic foci in aged neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that {PKR} inhibition leads to the cessation of stress, resumption of cellular translation, and restoration of {RNA}-binding protein expression. Together, our results identify a source of {RNA} stress that destabilizes aged neurons and may contribute to neurodegeneration.},

Down-regulation of {SUV}3 resulted in the accumulation of {mtdsRNAs} in the matrix, whereas down-regulation of {PNPase} resulted in the export of {mtdsRNAs} to the cytosol. Targeting experiments show that {PNPase} functions in both the intermembrane space and matrix. Strand-specific sequencing of the double-stranded {RNA} confirms the mitochondrial origin.

Finally, blockade of G3BP1 activity or depletion of mt-{dsRNA} decreased {TGFβ}-induced fibrotic responses.

The oxidative stress theory of aging is based on the hypothesis that age-associated functional losses are due to the accumulation of {RONS}-induced damages. At the same time, oxidative stress is involved in several age-related conditions (ie, cardiovascular diseases [{CVDs}], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer), including sarcopenia and frailty.

Given the important role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of many clinical conditions and aging, antioxidant therapy could positively affect the natural history of several diseases, but further investigation is needed to evaluate the real efficacy of these therapeutic interventions.

            Mitochondria are the energy production centers in cells and have unique genetic information. Due to the irreplaceable function of mitochondria, mitochondrial dysfunction often leads to pathological changes. Mitochondrial dysfunction induces an imbalance between oxidation and antioxidation, mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA}) damage, mitochondrial dynamics dysregulation, and changes in mitophagy. It results in oxidative stress due to excessive reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) generation, which contributes to cell damage and death. Mitochondrial dysfunction can also trigger inflammation through the activation of damage-associated molecular patterns ({DAMPs}), inflammasomes and inflammatory cells. Besides, mitochondrial alterations in the functional regulation, energy metabolism and genetic stability accompany the aging process, and there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, are predisposing factors of aging. Therefore, this review hypothesizes that mitochondria serve as central hubs regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and aging, and their dysfunction contributes to various diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases, sepsis, ocular pathologies, liver diseases, and autoimmune conditions. Moreover, we outline therapies aimed at various mitochondrial dysfunctions, highlighting their performance in animal models and human trials. Additionally, we focus on the limitations of mitochondrial therapy in clinical applications, and discuss potential future research directions for mitochondrial therapy.},

We describe the mapping and characterization of {RNA} elements recognized by a large collection of human {RBPs} in K562 and {HepG}2 cells. Integrative analyses using five assays identify {RBP} binding sites on {RNA} and chromatin in vivo, the in vitro binding preferences of {RBPs}, the function of {RBP} binding sites and the subcellular localization of {RBPs}, producing 1,223 replicated data sets for 356 {RBPs}. We describe the spectrum of {RBP} binding throughout the transcriptome and the connections between these interactions and various aspects of {RNA} biology, including {RNA} stability, splicing regulation and {RNA} localization.

              The B cell lymphoma 2 ({BCL}2) protein family critically controls apoptosis by regulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. In this cutting-edge review, we summarize the basic biology regulating the {BCL}2 family including canonical and non-canonical functions, and highlight milestones from basic research to clinical applications in cancer and other pathophysiological conditions. We review laboratory and clinical development of {BH}3-mimetics as well as more recent approaches including proteolysis targeting chimeras ({PROTACs}), antibody-drug conjugates ({ADCs}) and tools targeting the {BH}4 domain of {BCL}2. The first {BCL}2-selective {BH}3-mimetic, venetoclax, showed remarkable efficacy with manageable toxicities and has transformed the treatment of several hematologic malignancies. Following its success, several chemically similar {BCL}2 inhibitors such as sonrotoclax and lisaftoclax are currently under clinical evaluation, alone and in combination. Genetic analysis highlights the importance of {BCL}-X
              L
              and {MCL}1 across different cancer types and the possible utility of {BH}3-mimetics targeting these proteins. However, the development of {BH}3-mimetics targeting {BCL}-X
              L
              or {MCL}1 has been more challenging, with on-target toxicities including thrombocytopenia for {BCL}-X
              L
              and cardiac toxicities for {MCL}1 inhibitors precluding clinical development. Tumor-specific {BCL}-X
              L
              or {MCL}1 inhibition may be achieved by novel targeting approaches using {PROTACs} or selective drug delivery strategies and would be transformational in many subtypes of malignancy. Taken together, we envision that the targeting of {BCL}2 proteins, while already a success story of translational research, may in the foreseeable future have broader clinical applicability and improve the treatment of multiple diseases.},

Chronic inflammation is a critical factor in cancer development and progression. It affects every stage of tumor development, from initiation and promotion to invasion and metastasis. Tumors often create an inflammatory microenvironment that induces angiogenesis, immune suppression, and malignant growth. Immune cells within the tumor microenvironment interact actively with cancer cells, which drives progression through complex molecular mechanisms. Chronic inflammation is triggered by factors such as infections, obesity, and environmental toxins and is strongly linked to increased cancer risk. However, acute inflammatory responses can sometimes boost antitumor immunity; thus, inflammation presents both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This review examines how inflammation contributes to tumor biology, emphasizing its dual role as a critical factor in tumorigenesis and as a potential therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Complex formation between hexokinase-{II} ({HKII}) and the mitochondrial {VDAC}1 is crucial to cell growth and survival. We hypothesize that {HKII} first inserts into the outer membrane of mitochondria ({OMM}) and then interacts with {VDAC}1 on the cytosolic leaflet of {OMM} to form a binary complex. To systematically investigate this process, we devised a hybrid approach. First, we describe membrane binding of {HKII} with molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations employing a membrane mimetic model with enhanced lipid diffusion capturing membrane insertion of its H-anchor. The insertion depth of the H-anchor was then used to derive positional restraints in subsequent millisecond-scale Brownian dynamics ({BD}) simulations to preserve the membrane-bound pose of {HKII} during the formation of the {HKII}/{VDAC}1 binary complex. Multiple {BD}-derived structural models for the complex were further refined and their structural stability probed with additional {MD} simulations, resulting in one stable complex. A major feature in the complex is the partial (not complete) blockade of {VDAC}1’s permeation pathway, a result supported by our comparative electrophysiological measurements of the channel in the presence and absence of {HKII}. We also show how {VDAC}1 phosphorylation disrupts {HKII} binding, a feature that is verified by our electrophysiology recordings and has implications in mitochondria-mediated cell death.},

Here, we found that hyperosmotic stress for a few minutes induces Warburg-like metabolic remodeling in {HeLa} and Raw264.7 cells and suppresses fatty acid oxidation. Regarding Warburg-like remodeling, we determined that the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation status was altered bidirectionally (high in hyperosmolarity and low in hypoosmolarity) to osmotic stress in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondria themselves have an acute osmosensing mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate that Warburg-like remodeling is required for {HeLa} cells to maintain {ATP} levels and survive under hyperosmotic conditions.

However, {NHR}-180 exacerbates the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in genes required for oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent with these findings, we found that inhibition of the S6 kinase homolog {RSKS}-1 also increased mitochondrial function in

            worms. Importantly, treatment with an S6 kinase inhibitor also increased respiration and {mtDNA} content in mammalian {ATF}5-knockout cells and {OXPHOS}-deficient models, suggesting that translation regulation is a conserved, targetable approach for restoring mitochondrial function in disease.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              A complete view of human biology can only be achieved by studying the molecular components of its smallest functional unit, the cell. Cells are internally organized into compartments called organelles. The spatial partitioning provided by organelles creates an enclosed environment or surface for chemical reactions tailored to fulfill specific functions. These functions are tightly linked to a specific set of proteins. Therefore, resolving the subcellular location of the human proteome provides information about the function of the organelle and its underlying cellular mechanisms. We present a subcellular map of the human proteome, called the Cell Atlas, to facilitate functional exploration of individual proteins and their role in human biology and disease.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              Immunofluorescence ({IF}) microscopy was used to systematically resolve the spatial distribution of human proteins in cultivated cell lines and map them to cellular compartments and substructures with single-cell resolution. This approach allowed definition of the precise location of a majority of the human proteins in their cellular context and exploration of single-cell variations in protein expression patterns. The proteome-wide information about protein spatial distribution was validated with an orthogonal proteomics method, and the results were integrated into existing network models of protein-protein interactions for increased accuracy.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              We report a high-resolution characterization of the spatial subcellular distribution of the human proteome based on more than 80,000 confocal {IF} images. A total of 12,003 proteins targeted by 13,993 antibodies were classified into one or several of 30 cellular compartments and substructures, altogether defining the proteomes of 13 major organelles. The organelles with the largest proteomes were the nucleus and its substructures (6245 proteins), such as bodies and speckles, and the cytosol (4279 proteins). However, smaller organelles such as the midbody, rods and rings, and nucleoli also showed a larger diversity than previously recognized. Intriguingly, about half of all proteins were localized to multiple compartments, showing that there is a shared pool of proteins even among functionally unrelated organelles. Single-cell analysis revealed 1855 proteins with variation in their expression pattern, either in terms of expression levels or spatial distribution. Last, the spatial information was used to refine biological networks. Our location-pruned network that restricts protein interaction to the same organelle improved the accuracy of the human interactome model. The analysis also included transcriptomics data for all putative protein-coding genes (19,628) in 56 human cell lines of various origins. On average, cell lines expressed 11,490 genes, with half of them (6295) being expressed across all samples, suggesting a “housekeeping” role.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              
                The cellular proteome is compartmentalized and spatiotemporally regulated to a high degree. The high-resolution subcellular map of the human proteome that we provide describes this cellular complexity, with many multilocalizing proteins and single-cell variations. The map is presented as an interactive database called the Cell Atlas, part of the Human Protein Atlas (
                www.proteinatlas.org
                ). The Cell Atlas constitutes a key resource for a holistic understanding of the human cell and its complex underlying molecular machinery, as well as a major step toward modeling the human cell.
              
              
                
                  Creation of an image-based map of the human subcellular proteome.
                  The subcellular locations of 12,003 proteins were determined by {IF} microscopy in cell lines of various origins. High-resolution {IF} images such as those shown above enabled mapping of proteins to distinct subcellular structures. This resulted in the definition of the proteomes of 13 major cellular organelles, revealing multilocalizing proteins, as well as expression variability on a single-cell level.

            Resolving the spatial distribution of the human proteome at a subcellular level can greatly increase our understanding of human biology and disease. Here we present a comprehensive image-based map of subcellular protein distribution, the Cell Atlas, built by integrating transcriptomics and antibody-based immunofluorescence microscopy with validation by mass spectrometry. Mapping the in situ localization of 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level to 30 subcellular structures enabled the definition of the proteomes of 13 major organelles. Exploration of the proteomes revealed single-cell variations in abundance or spatial distribution and localization of about half of the proteins to multiple compartments. This subcellular map can be used to refine existing protein-protein interaction networks and provides an important resource to deconvolute the highly complex architecture of the human cell.},

            Similar to the situation in mammalian cells and yeast, messenger ribonucleo protein ({mRNP}) homeostasis in plant cells depends on rapid transitions between three functional states, i.e. translated {mRNPs} in polysomes, stored {mRNPs} and {mRNPs} under degradation. Studies in mammalian cells showed that whenever the dynamic exchange of the components between these states is disrupted, stalled {mRNPs} accumulate in cytoplasmic aggregates, such as stress granules ({SGs}) or processing bodies ({PBs}). We identified {PBs} and {SGs} in plant cells by detection of {DCP}1, {DCP}2 and {XRN}4, as marker proteins for the 5′→3′ {mRNA} degradation pathway, and {eIF}4E, as well as the {RNA} binding proteins {RBP}47 and {UBP}1, as marker proteins for stored {mRNPs} in {SGs}. Cycloheximide‐inhibited translation, stress treatments and mutants defective in {mRNP} homeostasis were used to study the dynamic transitions of {mRNPs} between {SGs} and {PBs}. {SGs} and {PBs} can be clearly discriminated from the previously described heat stress granules ({HSGs}), which evidently do not contain {mRNPs}. Thus, the role of {HSGs} as putative {mRNP} storage sites must be revised.},

              de novo
              establishment of heterochromatin are less well understood. Here, through a cross-based assay we have identified a novel factor influencing the efficiency of heterochromatin establishment. We determine that the previously uncharacterised protein is an ortholog of human Caprin1, an {RNA}-binding protein linked to stress granule formation. We confirm that the fission yeast ortholog, here named Cpn1, also associates with stress granules, and we uncover evidence of interplay between heterochromatin integrity and ribonucleoprotein ({RNP}) granule formation, with heterochromatin mutants showing reduced granule formation in the presence of stress, but increased granule formation in the absence of stress. We link this to regulation of non-coding heterochromatic transcripts, since in heterochromatin-deficient cells, Cpn1 can be seen to colocalise with accumulating pericentromeric transcripts, and absence of Cpn1 leads to hyperaccumulation of these {RNAs} at centromeres. Together, our findings unveil a novel link between {RNP} homeostasis and heterochromatin assembly, and implicate Cpn1 and associated factors in facilitating efficient heterochromatin establishment by enabling removal of excess transcripts that would otherwise impair assembly processes.},

            Cells limit energy-consuming {mRNA} translation during stress to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Sequestration of {mRNAs} by {RNA} binding proteins ({RBPs}) into {RNA} granules reduces their translation, but it remains unclear whether {RBPs} also function in partitioning of specific transcripts to polysomes ({PSs}) to guide selective translation and stress adaptation in cancer. To study transcript partitioning under cell stress, we catalogued {mRNAs} enriched in prostate carcinoma {PC}-3 cell {PSs}, as defined by polysome fractionation and {RNA} sequencing ({RNAseq}), and compared them to {mRNAs} complexed with the known {SG}-nucleator protein, G3BP1, as defined by spatially-restricted enzymatic tagging and {RNAseq}. By comparing these compartments before and after short-term arsenite-induced oxidative stress, we identified three major categories of transcripts, namely those that were G3BP1-associated and {PS}-depleted, G3BP1-dissociated and {PS}-enriched, and G3BP1-associated but also {PS}-enriched. Oxidative stress profoundly altered the partitioning of transcripts between these compartments. Under arsenite stress, G3BP1-associated and {PS}-depleted transcripts correlated with reduced expression of encoded mitochondrial proteins, {PS}-enriched transcripts that disassociated from G3BP1 encoded cell cycle and cytoprotective proteins whose expression increased, while transcripts that were both G3BP1-associated and {PS}-enriched encoded proteins involved in diverse stress response pathways. Therefore, G3BP1 guides transcript partitioning to reprogram {mRNA} translation and support stress adaptation.},

            Cells are compartmentalized to allow distinct processes to occur in membrane-delimited organelles. But similar spatial restriction of cellular components in membrane-less intracellular assemblies or condensates also appears to occur—much like oil droplets in water. These compartments contribute to multiple biological processes and regulatory mechanisms. Shin and Brangwynne review the protein-protein and protein-{RNA} interactions that result in formation of these structures. They explain known and potential functions of such structures in a range of examples, from signaling and local control of biochemical reactants to spatial segregation. In disease, such aggregation may go awry and contribute to neurodegenerative syndromes associated with inappropriate protein aggregation.

              {BACKGROUND}
              Living cells contain distinct subcompartments to facilitate spatiotemporal regulation of biological reactions. In addition to canonical membrane-bound organelles such as secretory vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, there are many organelles that do not have an enclosing membrane yet remain coherent structures that can compartmentalize and concentrate specific sets of molecules. Examples include assemblies in the nucleus such as the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, and nuclear speckles and also cytoplasmic structures such as stress granules, P-bodies, and germ granules. These structures play diverse roles in various biological processes and are also increasingly implicated in protein aggregation diseases.
            
            
              {ADVANCES}
              A number of studies have shown that membrane-less assemblies exhibit remarkable liquid-like features. As with conventional liquids, they typically adopt round morphologies and coalesce into a single droplet upon contact with one another and also wet intracellular surfaces such as the nuclear envelope. Moreover, component molecules exhibit dynamic exchange with the surrounding nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. These findings together suggest that these structures represent liquid-phase condensates, which form via a biologically regulated (liquid-liquid) phase separation process. Liquid phase condensation increasingly appears to be a fundamental mechanism for organizing intracellular space. Consistent with this concept, several membrane-less organelles have been shown to exhibit a concentration threshold for assembly, a hallmark of phase separation. At the molecular level, weak, transient interactions between molecules with multivalent domains or intrinsically disordered regions ({IDRs}) are a driving force for phase separation. In cells, condensation of liquid-phase assemblies can be regulated by active processes, including transcription and various posttranslational modifications. The simplest physical picture of a homogeneous liquid phase is often not enough to capture the full complexity of intracellular condensates, which frequently exhibit heterogeneous multilayered structures with partially solid-like characters. However, recent studies have shown that multiple distinct liquid phases can coexist and give rise to richly structured droplet architectures determined by the relative liquid surface tensions. Moreover, solid-like phases can emerge from metastable liquid condensates via multiple routes of potentially both kinetic and thermodynamic origins, which has important implications for the role of intracellular liquids in protein aggregation pathologies.
            
            
              {OUTLOOK}
              The list of intracellular assemblies driven by liquid phase condensation is growing rapidly, but our understanding of their sequence-encoded biological function and dysfunction lags behind. Moreover, unlike equilibrium phases of nonliving matter, living cells are far from equilibrium, with intracellular condensates subject to various posttranslational regulation and other adenosine triphosphate–dependent biological activity. Efforts using in vitro reconstitution, combined with traditional cell biology approaches and quantitative biophysical tools, are required to elucidate how such nonequilibrium features of living cells control intracellular phase behavior. The functional consequences of forming liquid condensates are likely multifaceted and may include facilitated reaction, sequestration of specific factors, and organization of associated intracellular structures. Liquid phase condensation is particularly interesting in the nucleus, given the growing interest in the impact of nuclear phase behavior on the flow of genetic information; nuclear condensates range from micrometer-sized bodies such as the nucleolus to submicrometer structures such as transcriptional assemblies, all of which directly interact with and regulate the genome. Deepening our understanding of these intracellular states of matter not only will shed light on the basic biology of cellular organization but also may enable therapeutic intervention in protein aggregation disease by targeting intracellular phase behavior.
              
                
                  Liquid phase condensation: An emerging paradigm of cellular organization.
                  Living cells contain various types of condensed liquid-like structures enriched with a distinct set of biomolecules that assemble through regulated phase separation. Sequence-encoded physicochemical properties lead to rich intracellular phase behaviors, including multiphase structuring and emergence of solid-like states from metastable liquids. Liquid condensates affect the flow of information in the cell, often through affecting {RNA} transcription and protein translation.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nonliving matter, and recent discoveries have shown that they also play a key role within living cells. Intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation is thought to drive the formation of condensed liquid-like droplets of protein, {RNA}, and other biomolecules, which form in the absence of a delimiting membrane. Recent studies have elucidated many aspects of the molecular interactions underlying the formation of these remarkable and ubiquitous droplets and the way in which such interactions dictate their material properties, composition, and phase behavior. Here, we review these exciting developments and highlight key remaining challenges, particularly the ability of liquid condensates to both facilitate and respond to biological function and how their metastability may underlie devastating protein aggregation diseases.},

Acetylation further directly impedes initiation at optimal {AUG} contexts: ac4C within {AUG}-flanking Kozak sequences reduced initiation in base-resolved transcriptome-wide {HeLa} results and in vitro utilizing substrates with site-specific ac4C incorporation. Cryo-{EM} of mammalian 80S initiation complexes revealed that ac4C in the -1 position adjacent to an {AUG} start codon disrupts an interaction between C and hypermodified t6A at nucleotide 37 of the initiator {tRNA}. These findings demonstrate the impact of {RNA} modifications on nucleobase function at a molecular level and introduce {mRNA} acetylation as a factor regulating translation in a location-specific manner.},

The subsequent decrease in {FAO} during long-term starvation reduces oxidative damage and rations {FAs} for longer use. Failure to form {SGs}, whether caused by the genetic deletion of {SG} components or an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS})-associated mutation, translates into an inability to downregulate {FAO}.

Furthermore, Ssd1 overexpression in young cells reduced translation and extended lifespan, while loss of Ssd1 reduced the translational deficit of old cells and shortened lifespan. Secondly, phosphorylation of {eIF}2α, mediated by the stress kinase Gcn2, was elevated in old cells, contributing to the global reduction in translation without detectable induction of the downstream Gcn4 transcriptional activator. {tRNA} overexpression activated Gcn2 in young cells and extended lifespan in a manner dependent on Gcn4.

	abstract = {Post-transcriptional mechanisms are fundamental safeguards of progenitor cell identity and are often dysregulated in cancer. Here, we identified regulators of P-bodies as crucial vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia ({AML}) through genome-wide {CRISPR} screens in normal and malignant haematopoietic progenitors. We found that leukaemia cells harbour aberrantly elevated numbers of P-bodies and show that P-body assembly is crucial for initiation and maintenance of {AML}. Notably, P-body loss had little effect upon homoeostatic haematopoiesis but impacted regenerative haematopoiesis. Molecular characterization of P-bodies purified from human {AML} cells unveiled their critical role in sequestering messenger {RNAs} encoding potent tumour suppressors from the translational machinery. P-body dissolution promoted translation of these {mRNAs}, which in turn rewired gene expression and chromatin architecture in leukaemia cells. Collectively, our findings highlight the contrasting and unique roles of {RNA} sequestration in P-bodies during tissue homoeostasis and oncogenesis. These insights open potential avenues for understanding myeloid leukaemia and future therapeutic interventions.},

In cases where {ER} stress cannot be reversed, cellular functions deteriorate, often leading to cell death.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of {CHAC}1's molecular functions, regulatory mechanisms, and effects in different pathological contexts. Specifically, the study objectives are to elucidate the biochemical pathways involving {CHAC}1, explore its regulatory network, and discuss its implications in disease progression and potential therapeutic strategies. As a γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase, {CHAC}1 degrades glutathione, affecting calcium signaling and mitochondrial function. Its regulation involves transcription factors like {ATF}4 and {ATF}3, which control {CHAC}1 {mRNA} expression. {CHAC}1 is crucial for maintaining redox balance and regulating cell death pathways in cancer. Its elevated levels are associated with poor prognosis in many cancers, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Additionally, {CHAC}1 influences non-cancerous diseases such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders. Therapeutically, targeting {CHAC}1 could increase cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis, aiding in overcoming resistance to standard treatments. This review compiles current knowledge and recent discoveries, emphasizing {CHAC}1's vital role in human diseases and its potential in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.},

Using {PHOTON}, we also reveal the functional role of m6A modification on {mRNA} partitioning into stress granules.

	abstract = {Splicing of the K-{SAM} alternative exon of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene is heavily dependent on the U-rich sequence {IAS}1 lying immediately downstream from its 5' splice site. We show that {IAS}1 can activate the use of several heterologous 5' splice sites in vitro. Addition of the {RNA}-binding protein {TIA}-1 to splicing extracts preferentially enhances the use of 5' splice sites linked to {IAS}1. {TIA}-1 can provoke a switch to use of such sites on pre-{mRNAs} with competing 5' splice sites, only one of which is adjacent to {IAS}1. Using a combination of {UV} cross-linking and specific immunoprecipitation steps, we show that {TIA}-1 binds to {IAS}1 in cell extracts. This binding is stronger if {IAS}1 is adjacent to a 5' splice site and is U1 {snRNP} dependent. Overexpression of {TIA}-1 in cultured cells activates K-{SAM} exon splicing in an {IAS}1-dependent manner. If {IAS}1 is replaced with a bacteriophage {MS}2 operator, splicing of the K-{SAM} exon can no longer be activated by {TIA}-1. Splicing can, however, be activated by a {TIA}-1-{MS}2 coat protein fusion, provided that the operator is close to the 5' splice site. Our results identify {TIA}-1 as a novel splicing regulator, which acts by binding to intron sequences immediately downstream from a 5' splice site in a U1 {snRNP}-dependent fashion. {TIA}-1 is distantly related to the yeast U1 {snRNP} protein Nam8p, and the functional similarities between the two proteins are discussed.},

Photo-irradiation of single cells demonstrated that approximately 8,000 genes were detected with 7 × 10 4 unique read counts. Furthermore, {PIC} transcriptome analysis is applicable to the subcellular and subnuclear microstructures (stress granules and nuclear speckles, respectively), where hundreds of genes can be detected as being specifically localised. The spatial density of the read counts is higher than 100 per square micrometre. Thus, {PIC} enables high-depth transcriptome profiles to be determined from limited regions up to subcellular and subnuclear resolutions.},

We show that {APEX}-seq can resolve the localization of {RNAs} within the cell and determine their enrichment or depletion near key {RNA}-binding proteins. Matching the spatial transcriptome, as revealed by {APEX}-seq, with the spatial proteome determined by {APEX}-mass spectrometry ({APEX}-{MS}), obtained precisely in parallel, provides new insights into the organization of translation initiation complexes on active {mRNAs} and unanticipated complexity in stress granule composition.

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference.

The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Overall, {coCLIP} provides a powerful method for revealing {RBP}-{RNA} interactions based on localization and lays the foundation for an advanced understanding of {RBP} models that incorporate subcellular location as a critical determinant of their functions.},

However, effective methods to capture both stable and transient interactions between {RBPs} and their {RNA} targets are still lacking, especially when the interaction is dynamic or samples are limited. Here we present an assay of reverse transcription-based {RBP} binding site sequencing ({ARTR}-seq), which relies on in situ reverse transcription of {RBP}-bound {RNAs} guided by antibodies to identify {RBP} binding sites. {ARTR}-seq avoids ultraviolet crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, allowing for efficient and specific identification of {RBP} binding sites from as few as 20 cells or a tissue section. Taking advantage of rapid formaldehyde fixation, {ARTR}-seq enables capturing the dynamic {RNA} binding by {RBPs} over a short period of time, as demonstrated by the profiling of dynamic {RNA} binding of G3BP1 during stress granule assembly on a timescale as short as 10 minutes.},

Genomes representing a greater diversity of species are increasingly being sequenced. In response, we have focussed our recent efforts on expediting the annotation of new assemblies. Here, we report the release of the greatest annual number of newly annotated genomes in the history of Ensembl via our dedicated Ensembl Rapid Release platform (http://rapid.ensembl.org). We have also developed a new method to generate comparative analyses at scale for these assemblies and, for the first time, we have annotated non-vertebrate eukaryotes. Meanwhile, we continually improve, extend and update the annotation for our high-value reference vertebrate genomes and report the details here. We have a range of specific software tools for specific tasks, such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor ({VEP}) and the newly developed interface for the Variant Recoder.

Currently available {RNA}-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. {RESULTS}: To align our large ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater80 billon reads) {ENCODE} Transcriptome {RNA}-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference ({STAR}) software based on a previously undescribed {RNA}-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. {STAR} outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, {STAR} can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length {RNA} sequences.

	abstract = {Abstract The presence of the m 6 A modification in mammalian {mRNAs} is proposed to promote {mRNA} recruitment to stress granules through the interaction with {YTHDF} proteins. We test this possibility by examining the accumulation of {mRNAs} in stress granules in both {WT} and ∆ {METTL}3 {mES} cells, which are deficient in m 6 A modification. A critical observation is that all m 6 A modified {mRNAs} partition similarly into stress granules in both wild-type and m 6 A-deficient cells by single-molecule {FISH}. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis indicates m 6 A modification explains only 6\% of the variance in stress granule localization when controlled for length. Finally, the artificial tethering of 25 {YTHDF} proteins on reporter {mRNAs} leads to only a modest increase in {mRNA} partitioning to stress granules. Since most mammalian {mRNAs} have 4 or fewer m 6 A sites, and those sites are not fully modified, this argues m 6 A modifications are unlikely to play a significant role in recruiting {mRNAs} to stress granules. Taken together, these observations argue that m 6 A modifications play a minimal, if any, role in {mRNA} partitioning into stress granules.},

	abstract = {To rapidly adapt to stresses such as infections, cells have evolved several mechanisms, which include the activation of stress response pathways and the innate immune response. These stress responses result in the rapid inhibition of translation and condensation of stalled {mRNAs} with {RNA}-binding proteins and signalling components into cytoplasmic biocondensates called stress granules ({SGs}). Increasing evidence suggests that {SGs} contribute to antiviral defence, and thus viruses need to evade these responses to propagate. We previously showed that feline calicivirus ({FCV}) impairs {SG} assembly by cleaving the scaffolding protein G3BP1. We also observed that uninfected bystander cells assembled G3BP1-positive granules, suggesting a paracrine response triggered by infection. We now present evidence that virus-free supernatant generated from infected cells can induce the formation of {SG}-like foci, which we name paracrine granules. They are linked to antiviral activity and exhibit specific kinetics of assembly-disassembly, and protein and {RNA} composition that are different from canonical {SGs}. We propose that this paracrine induction reflects a novel cellular defence mechanism to limit viral propagation and promote stress responses in bystander cells.},

However, the effect did not depend on p53 because i) there was no induction of p53 after the treatment with piericidin A; ii) after the treatment with myxothiazol the peak of {SESN}2 gene upregulation occurred as early as 5h, before the onset of p53 activation (13h); iii) a supplementation with uridine that abolishes the p53 activation in response to myxothiazol did not abrogate the induction of {SESN}2 transcripts; iv) in the p53 negative {HCT}116 p53 -/- cells {SESN}2 transcription could be also induced by myxothiazol. In response to the respiratory chain inhibitors we observed an induction of {ATF}4, the key transcription factor of the integrated stress response ({ISR}). We found that the induction of {SESN}2 transcripts could be prevented by the {ISR} inhibitory small molecule {ISRIB}. Also, by inhibiting or overexpressing {ATF}4 with specific {shRNA} or {ATF}4-expressing constructs, respectively, we have confirmed the role of {ATF}4 in the {SESN}2 gene upregulation induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. At a distance of 228 bp upstream from the {SESN}2 transcription start site we found a candidate sequence for the {ATF}4 binding site and confirmed its requirement for the induction of {SESN}2 in luciferase reporter experiments. We suggest that the upregulation of {SESN}2 by mitochondrial dysfunction provides a homeostatic feedback that attenuates biosynthetic processes during temporal losses of energy supply from mitochondria thereby assisting better adaptation and viability of cells in hostile environments.},

The fibrotic process finally results in organ malfunction and death if it is severely progressive. Fibrosis affects nearly all tissues of the body. The fibrosis process is associated with chronic inflammation, metabolic homeostasis, and transforming growth factor-β1 ({TGF}-β1) signaling, where the balance between the oxidant and antioxidant systems appears to be a key modulator in managing these processes. Virtually every organ system, including the lungs, heart, kidney, and liver, can be affected by fibrosis, which is characterized as an excessive accumulation of connective tissue components. Organ malfunction is frequently caused by fibrotic tissue remodeling, which is also frequently linked to high morbidity and mortality. Up to 45\% of all fatalities in the industrialized world are caused by fibrosis, which can damage any organ. Long believed to be persistently progressing and irreversible, fibrosis has now been revealed to be a very dynamic process by preclinical models and clinical studies in a variety of organ systems. The pathways from tissue damage to inflammation, fibrosis, and/or malfunction are the main topics of this review. Furthermore, the fibrosis of different organs with their effects was discussed. Finally, we highlight many of the principal mechanisms of fibrosis. These pathways could be considered as promising targets for the development of potential therapies for a variety of important human diseases.},

	abstract = {{TIA}-1 is an {RNA} binding protein that promotes the assembly of stress granules ({SGs}), discrete cytoplasmic inclusions into which stalled translation initiation complexes are dynamically recruited in cells subjected to environmental stress. The {RNA} recognition motifs of {TIA}-1 are linked to a glutamine-rich prion-related domain ({PRD}). Truncation mutants lacking the {PRD} domain do not induce spontaneous {SGs} and are not recruited to arsenite-induced {SGs}, whereas the {PRD} forms aggregates that are recruited to {SGs} in low-level-expressing cells but prevent {SG} assembly in high-level-expressing cells. The {PRD} of {TIA}-1 exhibits many characteristics of prions: concentration-dependent aggregation that is inhibited by the molecular chaperone heat shock protein ({HSP})70; resistance to protease digestion; sequestration of {HSP}27, {HSP}40, and {HSP}70; and induction of {HSP}70, a feedback regulator of {PRD} disaggregation. Substitution of the {PRD} with the aggregation domain of a yeast prion, {SUP}35-{NM}, reconstitutes {SG} assembly, confirming that a prion domain can mediate the assembly of {SGs}. Mouse embryomic fibroblasts ({MEFs}) lacking {TIA}-1 exhibit impaired ability to form {SGs}, although they exhibit normal phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor ({eIF})2alpha in response to arsenite. Our results reveal that prion-like aggregation of {TIA}-1 regulates {SG} formation downstream of {eIF}2alpha phosphorylation in response to stress.},

Accumulating evidence shows multiple links between mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns ({DAMPs}) are recognized by immune receptors of microglia and aggravate neuroinflammation. On the other hand, inflammatory factors released by activated glial cells trigger an intracellular cascade, which regulates mitochondrial metabolism and function. The crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammatory activation is a complex and dynamic process. There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction precedes neuroinflammation during the progression of diseases. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the specific molecular mechanisms associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and the progression of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases may contribute to the identification of new targets for the treatment of diseases. In this review, we describe in detail the {DAMPs} that induce or aggravate neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases including {mtDNA}, mitochondrial unfolded protein response ({mtUPR}), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ({mtROS}), adenosine triphosphate ({ATP}), transcription factor A mitochondria ({TFAM}), cardiolipin, cytochrome c , mitochondrial Ca 2+ and iron.},

	abstract = {Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy have been used to study the intracellular distributions of the major heat shock proteins, hsp 89, hsp 70, and hsp 24, in chicken embryo fibroblasts stressed by heat shock, allowed to recover and then restressed. Hsp 89 was localized primarily to the cytoplasm except during the restress when a portion of this protein concentrated in the nuclear region. Under all conditions, hsp 89 was readily extracted from cells by detergent. During stress and restress, significant amounts of hsp 70 moved to the nucleus and became resistant to detergent extraction. Some of this hsp 70 was released from the insoluble form in an {ATP}-dependent reaction. Hsp 24 was confined to the cytoplasm and, during restress, aggregated to detergent-insoluble perinuclear phase-dense granules. These granules dissociated during recovery and hsp 24 could be solubilized by detergent. The nuclear hsps reappeared in the cytoplasm in cells allowed to recover at normal temperatures. Sodium arsenite also induces hsps and their distributions were similar to that observed after a heat shock, except for hsp 89, which remained cytoplasmic. We also examined by immunofluorescence the cytoskeletal systems of chicken embryo fibroblasts subjected to heat shock and found no gross morphological changes in cytoplasmic microfilaments or microtubules. However, the intermediate filament network was very sensitive and collapsed around the nucleus very shortly after a heat shock. The normal intermediate filament morphology reformed when cells were allowed to recover from the stress. Inclusion of actinomycin D during the heat shock–a condition that prevents synthesis of the hsps–did not affect the intermediate filament collapse, but recovery of the normal morphology did not occur. We suggest that an hsp(s) may aid in the formation of the intermediate filament network after stress.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY}
              We address the developmental and evolutionary mechanisms underlying fore‐ and hindlimb development and progressive hindlimb reduction and skeletal loss in whales and evaluate whether the genetic, developmental, and evolutionary mechanisms thought to be responsible for limb loss in snakes “explain” loss of the hindlimbs in whales. Limb loss and concurrent morphological and physiological changes associated with the transition from land to water are discussed within the context of the current whale phylogeny. Emphasis is placed on fore‐ and hindlimb development, how the forelimbs transformed into flippers, and how the hindlimbs regressed, leaving either no elements or vestigial skeletal elements. Hindlimbs likely
              began
              to regress only after the ancestors of whales entered the aquatic environment: Hindlimb function was co‐opted by the undulatory vertical axial locomotion made possible by the newly evolved caudal flukes.
              Loss
              of the hindlimbs was associated with elongation of the body during the transition from land to water. Limblessness in most snakes is also associated with adoption of a new (burrowing) lifestyle and was driven by developmental changes associated with elongation of the body. Parallels between adaptation to burrowing or to the aquatic environment reflect structural and functional changes associated with the switch to axial locomotion. Because they are more fully studied and to determine whether hindlimb loss in lineages that are not closely related could result from similar genetically controlled developmental pathways, we discuss developmental (cellular and genetic) processes that may have driven limb loss in snakes and leg‐less lizards and compare these processes to the loss of hindlimbs in whales. In neither group does ontogenetic or phylogenetic limb reduction result from failure to initiate limb development. In both groups limb loss results from arrested development at the limb bud stage, as a result of inability to maintain necessary inductive tissue interactions and enhanced cell death over that seen in limbed tetrapods. An evolutionary change in
              Hox
              gene expression—as occurs in snakes—or in
              Hox
              gene regulation—as occurs in some limb‐less mutants—is unlikely to have initiated loss of the hindlimbs in cetaceans. Selective pressures acting on a wide range of developmental processes and adult traits other than the limbs are likely to have driven the loss of hindlimbs in whales.},

In this study, multiple observers used the nasal endoscope to determine the prevalence and character of the vomeronasal organ in humans. We performed nasal endoscopy on 22 cadaver heads and 78 live humans; we also biopsied cadaver specimens to histologically confirm the endoscopic diagnosis. We found evidence of this organ in 13 of the 22 cadavers (59.1\%) and in 22 of the 78 patients (28.2\%). Many nasal surgeons are unaware of this organ and its potential physiologic significance. It is our hope that by recognizing its prevalence and location, nasal surgeons will be more likely to identify and possibly preserve this mysterious organ until its function is more clearly understood.},

Sequencing analysis indicated that the isolated segment represented a 3'-part of the gene, where the regions corresponding to exons {VII}, {IX}, X, and {XII} of the rat L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene remain with probable deletion of the regions corresponding to exons {VIII} and {XI}. In the identified exon regions were found various anomalous nucleotide changes, such as deletion and insertion of nucleotide(s) and nonconformance to the {GT}/{AG} rule at intron/exon boundaries. When the conceptual amino acid sequences deduced from the four exon sequences were compared with the corresponding rat sequences, there were a large number of nonconservative substitutions and also two stop codons.

            Over 40 years ago, Raup and Sepkoski identified five episodes of elevated extinction in the marine fossil record that were thought to be statistically distinct, thus warranting the term the “Big Five” mass extinctions. Since then, the term has become part of standard vocabulary, especially with the naming of the current biodiversity crisis as the “sixth mass extinction.” However, there is no general agreement on which time intervals should be viewed as mass extinctions, in part because the Big Five turn out not to be statistically distinct from background rates of extinction, and in part, because other intervals of time have even higher extinction rates, in the Cambrian and early Ordovician. Nonetheless, the Big Five represent the five largest events since the early Ordovician, including in analyses that attempt to compensate for the incompleteness of the fossil and rock records. In the last 40 years, we have learned a great deal about the causes of many of the major and minor extinction events and are beginning to unravel the mechanisms that translated the initial environmental disturbances into extinction. However, for many of the events, further understanding will require going back to the outcrop, where the patchy distribution of environments and pervasive temporal gaps in the rock record challenge our ability to establish true extinction patterns. As for the current biodiversity crisis, there is no doubt that the rate of extinction is among the highest ever experienced by the biosphere, perhaps the second highest after the end-Cretaceous bolide impact. However (and fortunately), the absolute number of extinctions is still relatively small – there is still time to prevent this becoming a genuine mass extinction. Given the arbitrariness of calling out the Big Five, perhaps the current crisis should be called the “incipient Anthropocene mass extinction” rather than the “sixth mass extinction.”},

Phosphorylation of {eIF}2alpha by one or more of these kinases reduces the concentration of {eIF}2-guanosine triphosphate ({GTP})-transfer ribonucleic acid for methionine ({tRNA}(Met)), the ternary complex that loads {tRNA}(Met) onto the small ribosomal subunit to initiate protein translation. When ternary complex levels are reduced, the related {RNA}-binding proteins {TIA}-1 and {TIAR} promote the assembly of a noncanonical preinitiation complex that lacks {eIF}2-{GTP}-{tRNA}(Met). The {TIA} proteins dynamically sort these translationally incompetent preinitiation complexes into discrete cytoplasmic domains known as stress granules ({SGs}). {RNA}-binding proteins that stabilize or destabilize messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) are also recruited to {SGs} during stress. Thus, {TIA}-1 and {TIAR} act downstream of {eIF}2alpha phosphorylation to promote {SG} assembly and facilitate {mRNA} triage during stress. The role of the {SG} in the integration of translational efficiency, {mRNA} stability, and the stress response is discussed.},

The accumulation of untranslated {mRNA} at {SGs} is reversible in cells that recover from a sublethal stress, but irreversible in cells subjected to a lethal stress. We have found that the assembly of {TIA}-1/R(+) {SGs} is initiated by the phosphorylation of {eIF}-2alpha. A phosphomimetic {eIF}-2alpha mutant (S51D) induces the assembly of {SGs}, whereas a nonphosphorylatable {eIF}-2alpha mutant (S51A) prevents the assembly of {SGs}. The ability of a {TIA}-1 mutant lacking its {RNA}-binding domains to function as a transdominant inhibitor of {SG} formation suggests that this {RNA}-binding protein acts downstream of the phosphorylation of {eIF}-2alpha to promote the sequestration of untranslated {mRNAs} at {SGs}.

Phosphorylation of {eIF}2α on serine 51 results in a severe decline in de novo protein synthesis and is an important strategy in the cell's armory against stressful insults including viral infection, the accumulation of misfolded proteins, and starvation. The phosphorylation of {eIF}2α is carried out by a family of four kinases, {PERK} ({PKR}-like {ER} kinase), {PKR} (protein kinase double-stranded {RNA}-dependent), {GCN}2 (general control non-derepressible-2), and {HRI} (heme-regulated inhibitor). Each primarily responds to a distinct type of stress or stresses. Thus, while significant sequence similarity exists between the {eIF}2α kinases in their kinase domains, underlying their common role in phosphorylating {eIF}2α, additional unique features determine the regulation of these four proteins, that is, what signals activate them. This review will describe the structure of each {eIF}2α kinase and discuss how this is linked to their activation and function. In parallel to the general translational attenuation elicited by {eIF}2α kinase activation the translation of stress-induced {mRNAs}, most notably activating transcription factor 4 ({ATF}4) is enhanced and these set in motion cascades of gene expression constituting the integrated stress response ({ISR}), which seek to remediate stress and restore homeostasis. Depending on the cellular context and concurrent signaling pathways active, however, translational attenuation can also facilitate apoptosis. Accordingly, the role of the kinases in determining cell fate will also be discussed.},

Drugs that stabilize polysomes (emetine) inhibit the assembly of {SGs}, whereas drugs that destabilize polysomes (puromycin) promote the assembly of {SGs}. Moreover, emetine dissolves preformed {SGs} as it promotes the assembly of polysomes, suggesting that these {mRNP} species (i.e., {SGs} and polysomes) exist in equilibrium. We used green flourescent protein-tagged {SG}-associated {RNA}-binding proteins (specifically, {TIA}-1 and poly[A] binding protein [{PABP}-I]) to monitor {SG} assembly, disassembly, and turnover in live cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching shows that both {TIA}-1 and {PABP}-I rapidly and continuously shuttle in and out of {SGs}, indicating that the assembly of {SGs} is a highly dynamic process. This unexpected result leads us to propose that mammalian {SGs} are sites at which untranslated {mRNAs} are sorted and processed for either reinitiation, degradation, or packaging into stable nonpolysomal {mRNP} complexes. A truncation mutant of {TIA}-1 ({TIA}-1DeltaRRM), which acts as a transdominant inhibitor of {SG} assembly, promotes the expression of cotransfected reporter genes in {COS} transfectants, suggesting that this process of {mRNA} triage might, directly or indirectly, influence protein expression.},

Rescue experiments using G3BP1 mutants show that G3BP1-F33W, a mutant unable to bind G3BP partner proteins Caprin1 or {USP}10, rescues {SG} formation. Caprin1/{USP}10 binding to G3BP is mutually exclusive: Caprin binding promotes, but {USP}10 binding inhibits, {SG} formation. G3BP interacts with 40S ribosomal subunits through its {RGG} motif, which is also required for G3BP-mediated {SG} formation.

	abstract = {The massive uptake of compatible osmolytes such as betaine, taurine, and myo-inositol is a protective response shared by all eukaryotes exposed to hypertonic stress. Their accumulation results mostly from the expression of specific transporters triggered by the transcriptional factor {NFAT}5/{TonEBP}. This allows the recovery of the cell volume without increasing intracellular ionic strength. In this study we consider the assembly and dissociation of {mRNA} stress granules ({SGs}) in hypertonic-stressed cells and the role of compatible osmolytes. In agreement with in vitro results obtained on isolated {mRNAs}, both macromolecular crowding and a high ionic strength favor the assembly of {SGs} in normal rat kidney epithelial cells. However, after hours of constant hypertonicity, the slow accumulation in the cytoplasm of compatible osmolytes via specific transporters both reduces macromolecular crowding and ionic strength, thus leading to the progressive dissociation of {SGs}. In line with this, when cells are exposed to hypertonicity to accumulate a large amount of compatible osmolytes, the formation of {SGs} is severely impaired, and cells increase their chances of survival to another hypertonic episode. Altogether, these results indicate that the impact of compatible osmolytes on the {mRNA}-associated machineries and especially that associated with {SGs} may play an important role in cell resistance and adaption to hyperosmolarity in many tissues like kidney and liver.},

Despite the fact that {SGs} have been extensively studied for many years, their function is still not clear.

Aberrant formation of {SGs} and impaired {SG} disassembly majorly contribute to various pathological phenomena in cancer, viral infections, and neurodegeneration. The assembly of {SGs} is largely driven by liquid-liquid phase separation ({LLPS}), however, the molecular mechanisms behind that are not fully understood.

	abstract = {Stress granules are non-membrane bound {RNA}-protein ({RNP}) assemblies that form when translation initiation is limited and contain a biphasic structure with stable core structures surrounded by a less concentrated shell. The order of assembly and disassembly of these two structures remains unknown. Time course analysis of granule assembly suggests that core formation is an early event in granule assembly. Stress granule disassembly is also a stepwise process with shell dissipation followed by core clearance. Perturbations that alter liquid-liquid phase separations ({LLPS}) driven by intrinsically disordered protein regions ({IDR}) of {RNA} binding proteins in vitro have the opposite effect on stress granule assembly in vivo. Taken together, these observations argue that stress granules assemble through a multistep process initiated by stable assembly of untranslated {mRNPs} into core structures, which could provide sufficient high local concentrations to allow for a localized {LLPS} driven by {IDRs} on {RNA} binding proteins.},

The mammalian homologues Staufen 1 and Staufen 2 have been implicated in dendritic {RNA} targeting in neurons. Here we show that in rodent oligodendrocytes, these two proteins are present in two independent sets of {RNA} granules located at the distal myelinating processes. A third kind of {RNA} granules lacks Staufen and contains major myelin {mRNAs}. Myelin Staufen granules associate with microfilaments and microtubules, and their subcellular distribution is affected by polysome-disrupting drugs. Under oxidative stress, both Staufen 1 and Staufen 2 are recruited into stress granules ({SGs}), which are stress-induced organelles containing transiently silenced messengers. Staufen {SGs} contain the poly(A)-binding protein ({PABP}), the {RNA}-binding proteins {HuR} and {TIAR}, and small but not large ribosomal subunits. Staufen recruitment into perinuclear {SGs} is paralleled by a similar change in the overall localization of polyadenylated {RNA}. Under the same conditions, the distribution of recently transcribed and exported {mRNAs} is not affected. Our results indicate that Staufen 1 and Staufen 2 are novel and ubiquitous {SG} components and suggest that Staufen {RNPs} are involved in repositioning of most polysomal {mRNAs}, but not of recently synthesized transcripts, during the stress response.},

	abstract = {Stress granules ({SGs}) are membraneless cell compartments formed in response to different stress stimuli, wherein translation factors, {mRNAs}, {RNA}-binding proteins ({RBPs}) and other proteins coalesce together. {SGs} assembly is crucial for cell survival, since {SGs} are implicated in the regulation of translation, {mRNA} storage and stabilization and cell signalling, during stress. One defining feature of {SGs} is their dynamism, as they are quickly assembled upon stress and then rapidly dispersed after the stress source is no longer present. Recently, {SGs} dynamics, their components and their functions have begun to be studied in the context of human diseases. Interestingly, the regulated protein self-assembly that mediates {SG} formation contrasts with the pathological protein aggregation that is a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, aberrant protein coalescence is a key feature of polyglutamine ({PolyQ}) diseases, a group of nine disorders that are caused by an abnormal expansion of {PolyQ} tract-bearing proteins, which increases the propensity of those proteins to aggregate. Available data concerning the abnormal properties of the mutant {PolyQ} disease-causing proteins and their involvement in stress response dysregulation strongly suggests an important role for {SGs} in the pathogenesis of {PolyQ} disorders. This review aims at discussing the evidence supporting the existence of a link between {SGs} functionality and {PolyQ} disorders, by focusing on the biology of {SGs} and on the way it can be altered in a {PolyQ} disease context.},

On return to 25 degrees C, synthesis of normal proteins is gradually reactivated and that of {HSPs} is repressed. In quantifying many different recovery experiments, we found that preexisting {mRNAs} always behaved as a cohort, with messages for different proteins returning to translation at the same rate. Heat shock {mRNAs} ({HS} {mRNAs}), on the other hand, never behaved as a cohort. Their repression was asynchronous, with translation of hsp70 always the first and translation of hsp82 always the last to be repressed. Although recovery times varied enormously (depending on the severity of the heat treatment), repression of hsp70 was always correlated with restoration of normal synthesis, suggesting a link between the two events, hsp70 repression was not simply due to competition with reactivated 25 degrees C {mRNAs}. A general decline in the translation efficiency of hsp70 {mRNA} was not observed. Instead, an increasing number of messages were translationally inactivated, while those remaining in the translational pool retained full ribosome loading. Unlike inactive 25 degrees C {mRNAs}, which are stable during heat shock, inactive {HSP} {mRNAs} are degraded during recovery.},

Mild heat stress at 41-42 degrees C inhibits the fraction of active, polysomal ribosomes from greater than 60\% (preheating) to less than 30\%. A return to 37 degrees C leads to an increase in protein synthesis, termed "recovery." Continuous incubation at 41-42 degrees C also leads to a gradual restoration of protein synthesis (greater than 70\% of ribosomes reactivated by 2-4 h), termed "adaptation". Protein synthesis inhibition and reactivation is prestressed, recovered cells that contain elevated levels of the heat stress proteins occur to the same extent and at the same rate as in "naive" cells. The adaptation response requires transcription of new {RNA} whereas recovery does not. A large number of phosphorylation changes are induced by severe heat stress and occur with kinetics similar to the inhibition of protein synthesis. These include phosphorylation of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor ({eIF})-2 alpha and dephosphorylation of {eIF}-4B and {eIF}-4Fp25 ({eIF}-4E). However, the extent to which the modification occurs is proportional to the severity of the stress, and, under mild (41-42 degrees C) heat stress conditions, these initiation factor phosphorylation changes do not occur. Similarly, under conditions of severe heat stress {eIF}-2 alpha and {eIF}-4B frequently recover to their prestress phosphorylation state before the recovery of protein synthesis. {eIF}-4E dephosphorylation likewise does not occur under mild heat stress conditions. Therefore, these changes in phosphorylation states, which are thought to be sufficient cause, are not necessary for the inhibition of protein synthesis observed.},

Intriguingly, interfering with the last step of translation initiation by blocking the recruitment of 60S ribosome either with 2-(4-methyl-2,6-dinitroanilino)-N-methylpropionamideis or through depletion of the large ribosomal subunits protein L28 does not induce {SG} assembly.

To protect against these adverse conditions and promote recovery, cells undergo dramatic changes upon exposure to stress. This involves activation of signaling pathways, cell cycle arrest, translational reprogramming, and reorganization of the cytoplasm. Notably, many stress conditions cause a global inhibition of {mRNA} translation accompanied by the formation of cytoplasmic condensates called stress granules ({SGs}), which sequester {mRNA} together with {RNA}‐binding proteins, translation initiation factors, and other components. {SGs} are highly conserved in eukaryotes, suggesting that they perform an important function during the stress response. Over the years, many different roles have been assigned to {SGs}, including translational control, {mRNA} storage, regulation of {mRNA} decay, antiviral innate immune response, and modulation of signaling pathways. Most of our understanding, however, has been deduced from correlative data based upon the composition of {SGs} and only recently have technological innovations allowed hypotheses for {SG} function to be directly tested.

            Rbfox {RNA}-binding proteins play important roles in the regulation of alternative pre-{mRNA} splicing, but their role in other gene regulatory mechanisms is not well understood. Here, we show that Rbfox2 is a novel constituent of cytoplasmic stress granules, the translational silencing machinery assembled in response to cellular stress. We also show that the {RNA} binding activity of the Rbfox family protein is crucial for its localization into stress granules. To investigate the role of Rbfox2 in stress granules we used {RNA}-immunoprecipitation sequencing to identify cytoplasmic transcriptome-wide targets of Rbfox2. We report that a subset of cell cycle-related genes including retinoblastoma 1 is the target of Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules, and Rbfox2 regulates the retinoblastoma 1 {mRNA} and protein expression levels during and following stress exposure. Our study proposes a novel function for Rbfox2 in cytoplasmic stress granules.},

We demonstrate that the {SG}-enriched {NORAD} {RNA} is sufficient to enrich a reporter {RNA} within {SGs} through the combined effects of multiple elements. Moreover, artificial tethering of G3BP1, {TIA}1, or {FMRP} can target {mRNAs} into {SGs} in a dose-dependent manner with numerous interactions required for efficient {SG} partitioning, which suggests individual protein interactions have small effects on the {SG} partitioning of {mRNPs}.

          Stress-induced {mRNP} condensation is conserved across eukaryotes, resulting in stress granule formation under intense stresses, yet the {mRNA} composition and function of these condensates remain unclear. Exposure of ribosome-free {mRNA} following stress is thought to cause condensation and stress granule formation through {mRNA}-sequence-dependent interactions, leading to disproportionate condensation of long {mRNAs}. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all {mRNAs} condense in response to multiple stresses in budding yeast with minor length dependence and often without stress granule formation. New transcripts escape {mRNP} condensation, enabling their selective translation. Inhibiting translation initiation causes formation of {mRNP} condensates that are distinct from stress granules and P-bodies; these translation-initiation-inhibited condensates ({TIICs}) are omnipresent, even in unstressed cells. Stress-induced {mRNAs} are excluded from {TIICs} due to the timing of their expression, indicating determinants of escape that are independent of sequence. Together, our results reveal a previously undetected level of translation-linked molecular organization and stress-responsive regulation.},

	abstract = {The protein ataxin-3 contains a polyglutamine region; increasing the number of glutamines beyond 55 in this region gives rise to the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. This disease and other polyglutamine expansion diseases are characterized by large intranuclear protein aggregates (nuclear inclusions). By using full-length human ataxin-3, we have investigated the changes in secondary structure, aggregation behavior, and fibril formation associated with an increase from the normal length of 27 glutamines (Q27 ataxin-3) to a pathogenic length of 78 glutamines (Q78 ataxin-3). Q78 ataxin-3 aggregates strongly and could be purified only when expressed with a solubility-enhancing fusion-protein partner. A marked decrease in α-helical secondary structure accompanies expansion of the polyglutamine tract, suggesting destabilization of the native protein. Proteolytic removal of the fusion partner in the Q78 protein, but not in the Q27 protein, leads to the formation of {SDS}-resistant aggregates and Congo-red reactive fibrils. Infrared spectroscopy of fibrils reveals a high β-sheet content and suggests a parallel, rather than an antiparallel, sheet conformation. We present a model for a polar zipper composed of parallel polyglutamine β-sheets. Our data show that intact ataxin-3 is fully competent to form aggregates, and posttranslational cleavage or other processing is not necessary to generate a misfolding event. The data also suggest that the protein aggregation phenotype associated with glutamine expansion may derive from two effects: destabilization of the native protein structure and an inherent propensity for β-fibril formation on the part of glutamine homopolymers.},

              Flaviviruses
              are a major cause of disease in humans and animals worldwide. Tick-borne encephalitis virus ({TBEV}) is the most important arthropod-borne flavivirus endemic in Europe and is the etiological agent of tick-borne encephalitis, a potentially fatal infection of the central nervous system. However, the contributions of host proteins during {TBEV} infection are poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the cellular protein {TIA}-1 and its cognate factor {TIAR}, which are stress-induced {RNA}-binding proteins involved in the repression of initiation of translation of cellular {mRNAs} and in the formation of stress granules. We show that {TIA}-1 and {TIAR} interact with viral {RNA} in {TBEV}-infected cells. During {TBEV} infection, cytoplasmic {TIA}-1 and {TIAR} are recruited at sites of viral replication with concomitant depletion from stress granules. This effect is specific, since G3BP1, another component of these cytoplasmic structures, remains localized to stress granules. Moreover, heat shock induction of stress granules containing {TIA}-1, but not G3BP1, is inhibited in {TBEV}-infected cells. Infection of cells depleted of {TIA}-1 or {TIAR} by small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) or {TIA}-1
              −/−
              mouse fibroblasts, leads to a significant increase in {TBEV} extracellular infectivity. Interestingly, {TIAR}
              −/−
              fibroblasts show the opposite effect on {TBEV} infection, and this phenotype appears to be related to an excess of {TIA}-1 in these cells. Taking advantage of a {TBE}-luciferase replicon system, we also observed increased luciferase activity in {TIA}-1
              −/−
              mouse fibroblasts at early time points, consistent with {TIA}-1-mediated inhibition at the level of the first round of viral translation. These results indicate that, in response to {TBEV} infection, {TIA}-1 is recruited to sites of virus replication to bind {TBEV} {RNA} and modulate viral translation independently of stress granule ({SG}) formation.
            
            
              {IMPORTANCE}
              This study (i) extends previous work that showed {TIA}-1/{TIAR} recruitment at sites of flavivirus replication, (ii) demonstrates that {TIAR} behaves like {TIA}-1 as an inhibitor of viral replication using an {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) approach in human cells that contradicts the previous hypothesis based on mouse embryonic fibroblast ({MEF}) knockouts only, (iii) demonstrates that tick-borne encephalitis virus ({TBEV}) is capable of inducing bona fide G3BP1/{eIF}3/{eIF}4B-positive stress granules, (iv) demonstrates a differential phenotype of stress response proteins following viral infection, and (v) implicates {TIA}-1 in viral translation and as a modulator of {TBEV} replication.},

Virus‐induced {SGs} function in different ways, depending on the species of virus; however, the mechanism of {SG} regulation of virus replication is not well understood. In this study, Newcastle disease virus ({NDV}) triggered stable formation of
              bona fide
              {SGs} on {HeLa} cells through activating the protein kinase R ({PKR})/{eIF}2α pathway. {NDV}‐induced {SGs} contained classic {SG} markers T‐cell internal antigen ({TIA})‐1, Ras {GTPase}‐activating protein‐binding protein (G3BP)‐1, eukaryotic initiation factors, and small ribosomal subunit, which could be disassembled in the presence of cycloheximide. Treatment with nocodazole, a microtubule disruption drug, led to the formation of relatively small and circular granules, indicating that {NDV} infection induces canonical {SGs}. Furthermore, the role of {SGs} on {NDV} replication was investigated by knockdown of {TIA}‐1 and {TIA}‐1‐related ({TIAR}) protein, the 2 critical components involved in {SG} formation from the {HeLa} cells, followed by {NDV} infection.

            {ABSTRACT}
            Stress granule ({SG}) formation is generally triggered as a result of stress-induced translation arrest. The impact of {SG} formation on virus replication varies among different viruses, and the significance of {SGs} in coronavirus ({CoV}) replication is largely unknown. The present study examined the biological role of {SGs} in Middle East respiratory syndrome ({MERS})-{CoV} replication. The {MERS}-{CoV} 4a accessory protein is known to inhibit {SG} formation in cells in which it was expressed by binding to double-stranded {RNAs} and inhibiting protein kinase R ({PKR})-mediated phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 ({eIF}2α). Replication of {MERS}-{CoV} lacking the genes for 4a and 4b ({MERS}-{CoV}-Δp4), but not {MERS}-{CoV}, induced {SG} accumulation in {MERS}-{CoV}-susceptible {HeLa}/{CD}26 cells, while replication of both viruses failed to induce {SGs} in Vero cells, demonstrating cell type-specific differences in {MERS}-{CoV}-Δp4-induced {SG} formation. {MERS}-{CoV}-Δp4 replicated less efficiently than {MERS}-{CoV} in {HeLa}/{CD}26 cells, and inhibition of {SG} formation by small interfering {RNA}-mediated depletion of the {SG} components promoted {MERS}-{CoV}-Δp4 replication, demonstrating that {SG} formation was detrimental for {MERS}-{CoV} replication. Inefficient {MERS}-{CoV}-Δp4 replication was not due to either the induction of type I and type {III} interferons or the accumulation of viral {mRNAs} in the {SGs}. Rather, it was due to the inefficient translation of viral proteins, which was caused by high levels of {PKR}-mediated {eIF}2α phosphorylation and likely by the confinement of various factors that are required for translation in the {SGs}. Finally, we established that deletion of the 4a gene alone was sufficient for inducing {SGs} in infected cells. Our study revealed that 4a-mediated inhibition of {SG} formation facilitates viral translation, leading to efficient {MERS}-{CoV} replication.

            {ABSTRACT}
            
              Flaviviruses limit the cell stress response by preventing the formation of stress granules ({SGs}) and modulate viral gene expression by subverting different proteins involved in the stress granule pathway. In this study, we investigated the formation of stress granules during Zika virus ({ZIKV}) infection and the role stress granule proteins play during the viral life cycle. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we determined that {ZIKV} disrupted the formation of arsenite-induced stress granules and changed the subcellular distribution, but not the abundance or integrity, of stress granule proteins. We also investigated the role of different stress granule proteins in {ZIKV} infection by using target-specific short interfering {RNAs} to deplete Ataxin2, G3BP1, {HuR}, {TIA}-1, {TIAR}, and {YB}1. Knockdown of {TIA}-1 and {TIAR} affected {ZIKV} protein and {RNA} levels but not viral titers. Conversely, depletion of Ataxin2 and {YB}1 decreased virion production despite having only a small effect on {ZIKV} protein expression. Notably, however, depletion of G3BP1 and {HuR} decreased and increased {ZIKV} gene expression and virion production, respectively. Using an {MR}766
              Gaussia
              Luciferase reporter genome together with knockdown and overexpression assays, G3BP1 and {HuR} were found to modulate {ZIKV} replication. These data indicate that {ZIKV} disrupts the formation of stress granules by sequestering stress granule proteins required for replication, where G3BP1 functions to promote {ZIKV} infection while {HuR} exhibits an antiviral effect. The results of {ZIKV} relocalizing and subverting select stress granule proteins might have broader consequences on cellular {RNA} homeostasis and contribute to cellular gene dysregulation and {ZIKV} pathogenesis.

The host protein, Staufen1 interacts directly with Gag and is found in ribonucleoprotein ({RNP}) complexes containing {vRNA}, which provides evidence that Staufen1 plays a role in {vRNA} selection and encapsidation. In this work, we show that Staufen1, {vRNA} and Gag are found in the same {RNP} complex. These cellular and viral factors also colocalize in cells and constitute novel Staufen1 {RNPs} ({SHRNPs}) whose assembly is strictly dependent on {HIV}-1 expression. {SHRNPs} are distinct from stress granules and processing bodies, are preferentially formed during oxidative stress and are found to be in equilibrium with translating polysomes. Moreover, {SHRNPs} are stable, and the association between Staufen1 and {vRNA} was found to be evident in these and other types of {RNPs}. We demonstrate that following Staufen1 depletion, apparent supraphysiologic-sized {SHRNP} foci are formed in the cytoplasm and in which Gag, {vRNA} and the residual Staufen1 accumulate. The depletion of Staufen1 resulted in reduced Gag levels and deregulated the assembly of newly synthesized virions, which were found to contain several-fold increases in {vRNA}, Staufen1 and other cellular proteins. This work provides new evidence that Staufen1-containing {HIV}-1 {RNPs} preferentially form over other cellular silencing foci and are involved in assembly, localization and encapsidation of {vRNA}.},

Different groups of double-stranded {RNA} viruses derive either from {dsRNA} bacteriophages or from positive-strand {RNA} viruses. The eukaryotic {ssDNA} viruses apparently evolved via a fusion of genes from prokaryotic rolling circle-replicating plasmids and positive-strand {RNA} viruses. Different families of eukaryotic {dsDNA} viruses appear to have originated from specific groups of bacteriophages on at least two independent occasions. Polintons, the largest known eukaryotic transposons, predicted to also form virus particles, most likely, were the evolutionary intermediates between bacterial tectiviruses and several groups of eukaryotic {dsDNA} viruses including the proposed order "Megavirales" that unites diverse families of large and giant viruses.

            Many biological processes, including cellular senescence, manifest as diverse phenotypes that vary across cell types and conditions. In the absence of single, definitive markers, researchers often rely on the expression of sets of genes to identify these complex states. However, there are multiple ways to summarise gene set expression into quantitative metrics (
            i.e.,
            signatures), each with its own strengths and limitations, and we know of no consensual framework to systematically evaluate their performance across datasets. We therefore developed
            {markeR}
            (
            https://bioconductor.org/packages/{markeR}
            ), an open-source, modular
            R
            package that evaluates gene sets as phenotypic {markeRs} using various scoring and enrichment-based approaches.
            {markeR}
            generates interpretable metrics and intuitive visualisations that enable benchmarking of gene signatures and exploration of their associations with chosen study variables. As a case study, we applied
            {markeR}
            to 9 published senescence-related gene sets across 25 {RNA}-seq datasets, covering 6 human cell types and 12 senescence-inducing conditions. There was wide variability in gene set performance, as some signatures (
            e.g.
            , {SenMayo}) were robust senescence markers across contexts, while others (
            e.g.
            , those from {MSigDB}), performed poorly as such. We also used
            {markeR}
            to analyse gene expression in 49 {GTEx} tissues, revealing tissue- and age-related differences in senescence-associated signals. Together, these findings emphasise the difficulty of characterising molecular phenotypes and demonstrate the potential of
            {markeR}
            in facilitating the systematic evaluation of gene sets in various biological contexts.},

            Cellular senescence is a known driver of carcinogenesis and age-related diseases, yet senescence is required for various physiological processes. However, the mechanisms and factors that control the negative effects of senescence while retaining its benefits are still elusive. Here, we show that the {rasGAP} {SH}3-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is required for the activation of the senescent-associated secretory phenotype ({SASP}). During senescence, G3BP1 achieves this effect by promoting the association of the cyclic {GMP}-{AMP} synthase ({cGAS}) with cytosolic chromatin fragments. In turn, G3BP1, through {cGAS}, activates the {NF}-κB and {STAT}3 pathways, promoting {SASP} expression and secretion. G3BP1 depletion or pharmacological inhibition impairs the {cGAS}-pathway preventing the expression of {SASP} factors without affecting cell commitment to senescence. These {SASPless} senescent cells impair senescence-mediated growth of cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Our data reveal that G3BP1 is required for {SASP} expression and that {SASP} secretion is a primary mediator of senescence-associated tumor growth.},

	abstract = {{RNA}-binding proteins ({RBPs}) comprise a large class of over 2,000 proteins that interact with transcripts in all manner of {RNA}-driven processes. The structures and mechanisms that {RBPs} use to bind and regulate {RNA} are incredibly diverse. In this review, we take a look at the components of protein-{RNA} interaction, from the molecular level to multi-component interaction. We first summarize what is known about protein-{RNA} molecular interactions based on analyses of solved structures. We additionally describe software currently available for predicting protein-{RNA} interaction and other resources useful for the study of {RBPs}. We then review the structure and function of seventeen known {RNA}-binding domains and analyze the hydrogen bonds adopted by protein-{RNA} structures on a domain-by-domain basis. We conclude with a summary of the higher-level mechanisms that regulate protein-{RNA} interactions.},

	abstract = {The fundamental essence of life is based on process of interaction between nucleic acids and proteins. In a prebiotic world, amino acids, peptides, ions, and other metabolites acted in protobiotic routes at the same time on which {RNAs} performed catalysis and self-replication. Nevertheless, it was only when nucleic acids and peptides started to interact together in an organized process that life emerged. First, the ignition was sparked with the formation of a Peptidyl Transferase Center ({PTC}), possibly by concatenation of proto-{tRNAs}. This molecule that would become the catalytic site of ribosomes started a process of self-organization that gave origin to a protoorganism named {FUCA}, a ribonucleic ribosomal-like apparatus capable to polymerize amino acids. In that sense, we review hypotheses about the origin and early evolution of the genetic code. Next, populations of open biological systems named progenotes were capable of accumulating and exchanging genetic material, producing the first genomes. Progenotes then evolved in two paths: some presented their own ribosomes and others used available ribosomes in the medium to translate their encoded information. At some point, two different types of organisms emerged from populations of progenotes: the ribosome-encoding organisms (cells) and the capsid-encoding organisms (viruses).},

However, since the regulation of {RBPs} is reliant on the micro-environment and events like stress response and metabolism, their binding affinities and the resulting {RNA}-{RBP} networks may be affected. Therefore, any misregulation and disruption in the features of {RNA} and its related homeostasis can lead to a number of diseases that include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other disorders such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. As such, correct regulation of {RNA} and {RBPs} is crucial to good health as the effect {RBPs} exert through loss of function can cause pathogenesis.

	abstract = {The canonical molecular machinery required for global {mRNA} translation and its control has been well defined, with distinct sets of proteins involved in the processes of translation initiation, elongation and termination. Additionally, noncanonical, trans-acting regulatory {RNA}-binding proteins ({RBPs}) are necessary to provide {mRNA}-specific translation, and these interact with 5' and 3' untranslated regions and coding regions of {mRNA} to regulate ribosome recruitment and transit. Recently it has also been demonstrated that trans-acting ribosomal proteins direct the translation of specific {mRNAs}. Importantly, it has been shown that subsets of {RBPs} often work in concert, forming distinct regulatory complexes upon different cellular perturbation, creating an {RBP} combinatorial code, which through the translation of specific subsets of {mRNAs}, dictate cell fate. With the development of new methodologies, a plethora of novel {RNA} binding proteins have recently been identified, although the function of many of these proteins within {mRNA} translation is unknown. In this review we will discuss these methodologies and their shortcomings when applied to the study of translation, which need to be addressed to enable a better understanding of trans-acting translational regulatory proteins. Moreover, we discuss the protein domains that are responsible for {RNA} binding as well as the {RNA} motifs to which they bind, and the role of trans-acting ribosomal proteins in directing the translation of specific {mRNAs}.

Here, we report that V2 and V3 are generated by alternative polyadenylation, and neither protein contains all seven {WD} (tryptophan-aspartic acid) repeats that characterize V1. Surprisingly, V2 and V3 are not polyadenylation factors but localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and interact with stimulator of interferon genes ({STING}), the immune factor that induces the cellular response to cytosolic double-stranded {DNA}. V2 suppresses interferon-β induction by preventing {STING} disulfide oligomerization but promotes autophagy, likely by recruiting {WIPI}2 isoforms. V3, on the other hand, functions to increase {STING} protein levels.

We report here the 3.4 Å resolution crystal structure of the first three domains of human {NXF}1 together with {NXT}1 that has two copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit arranged to form an intimate domain-swapped dimer. In this dimer, the linkers between the {NXF}1 {LRR} and {NTF}2-like domains interact with {NXT}1, generating a 2-fold symmetric platform in which the {RNA}-binding {RRM}, {LRR} and {NTF}2-like domains are arranged on one face.

	abstract = {Alternative splicing ({AS}) generates remarkable regulatory and proteomic complexity in metazoans. However, the functions of most {AS} events are not known, and programs of regulated splicing remain to be identified. To address these challenges, we describe the Vertebrate Alternative Splicing and Transcription Database ({VastDB}), the largest resource of genome-wide, quantitative profiles of {AS} events assembled to date. {VastDB} provides readily accessible quantitative information on the inclusion levels and functional associations of {AS} events detected in {RNA}-seq data from diverse vertebrate cell and tissue types, as well as developmental stages. The {VastDB} profiles reveal extensive new intergenic and intragenic regulatory relationships among different classes of {AS} and previously unknown and conserved landscapes of tissue-regulated exons. Contrary to recent reports concluding that nearly all human genes express a single major isoform, {VastDB} provides evidence that at least 48\% of multiexonic protein-coding genes express multiple splice variants that are highly regulated in a cell/tissue-specific manner, and that {\textgreater}18\% of genes simultaneously express multiple major isoforms across diverse cell and tissue types. Isoforms encoded by the latter set of genes are generally coexpressed in the same cells and are often engaged by translating ribosomes. Moreover, they are encoded by genes that are significantly enriched in functions associated with transcriptional control, implying they may have an important and wide-ranging role in controlling cellular activities. {VastDB} thus provides an unprecedented resource for investigations of {AS} function and regulation.},

	abstract = {{RNA}-binding proteins ({RBPs}) with prion-like domains ({PrLDs}) phase transition to functional liquids, which can mature into aberrant hydrogels composed of pathological fibrils that underpin fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Several nuclear {RBPs} with {PrLDs}, including {TDP}-43, {FUS}, {hnRNPA}1, and {hnRNPA}2, mislocalize to cytoplasmic inclusions in neurodegenerative disorders, and mutations in their {PrLDs} can accelerate fibrillization and cause disease. Here, we establish that nuclear-import receptors ({NIRs}) specifically chaperone and potently disaggregate wild-type and disease-linked {RBPs} bearing a {NLS}. Karyopherin-β2 (also called Transportin-1) engages {PY}-{NLSs} to inhibit and reverse {FUS}, {TAF}15, {EWSR}1, {hnRNPA}1, and {hnRNPA}2 fibrillization, whereas Importin-α plus Karyopherin-β1 prevent and reverse {TDP}-43 fibrillization. Remarkably, Karyopherin-β2 dissolves phase-separated liquids and aberrant fibrillar hydrogels formed by {FUS} and {hnRNPA}1. In vivo, Karyopherin-β2 prevents {RBPs} with {PY}-{NLSs} accumulating in stress granules, restores nuclear {RBP} localization and function, and rescues degeneration caused by disease-linked {FUS} and {hnRNPA}2. Thus, {NIRs} therapeutically restore {RBP} homeostasis and mitigate neurodegeneration.},

Their function is not limited to energy production but serves multiple mechanisms varying from iron and calcium homeostasis to the production of hormones and neurotransmitters, such as melatonin. They enable and influence communication at all physical levels through interaction with other organelles, the nucleus, and the outside environment. The literature suggests crosstalk mechanisms between mitochondria and circadian clocks, the gut microbiota, and the immune system. They might even be the hub supporting and integrating activity across all these domains. Hence, they might be the (missing) link in both health and disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to metabolic syndrome, neuronal diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and infectious diseases, and inflammatory disorders. In this regard, diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}), chronic fatigue syndrome ({CFS}), and chronic pain are discussed. This review focuses on understanding the mitochondrial mechanisms of action that allow for the maintenance of mitochondrial health and the pathways toward dysregulated mechanisms. Although mitochondria have allowed us to adapt to changes over the course of evolution, in turn, evolution has shaped mitochondria. Each evolution-based intervention influences mitochondria in its own way. The use of physiological stress triggers tolerance to the stressor, achieving adaptability and resistance. This review describes strategies that could recover mitochondrial functioning in multiple diseases, providing a comprehensive, root-cause-focused, integrative approach to recovering health and treating people suffering from chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {Endosymbiosis and organellogenesis are virtually unknown among prokaryotes. The single presumed example is the endosymbiogenetic origin of mitochondria, which is hidden behind the event horizon of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. While eukaryotes are monophyletic, it is unlikely that during billions of years, there were no other prokaryote-prokaryote endosymbioses as symbiosis is extremely common among prokaryotes, e.g., in biofilms. Therefore, it is even more precarious to draw conclusions about potentially existing (or once existing) prokaryotic endosymbioses based on a single example. It is yet unknown if the bacterial endosymbiont was captured by a prokaryote or by a (proto-)eukaryote, and if the process of internalization was parasitic infection, slow engulfment, or phagocytosis. In this review, we accordingly explore multiple mechanisms and processes that could drive the evolution of unicellular microbial symbioses with a special attention to prokaryote-prokaryote interactions and to the mitochondrion, possibly the single prokaryotic endosymbiosis that turned out to be a major evolutionary transition. We investigate the ecology and evolutionary stability of inter-species microbial interactions based on dependence, physical proximity, cost-benefit budget, and the types of benefits, investments, and controls. We identify challenges that had to be conquered for the mitochondrial host to establish a stable eukaryotic lineage. Any assumption about the initial interaction of the mitochondrial ancestor and its contemporary host based solely on their modern relationship is rather perilous. As a result, we warn against assuming an initial mutually beneficial interaction based on modern mitochondria-host cooperation. This assumption is twice fallacious: (i) endosymbioses are known to evolve from exploitative interactions and (ii) cooperativity does not necessarily lead to stable mutualism. We point out that the lack of evidence so far on the evolution of endosymbiosis from mutual syntrophy supports the idea that mitochondria emerged from an exploitative (parasitic or phagotrophic) interaction rather than from syntrophy.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              The influence of Ficus extends beyond its numbers (887 species), and fig trees are often keystone species in their habitats. Ficus fills many tropical forest niches. The past 15 years have witnessed an explosion of research on Ficus and its obligate mutualists in the chalcid family Agaonidae, but also on its wider community of interactants. Long-standing ideas have been challenged, and pathways to speciation have been explored. We aim to stimulate collegiate discussion: why are there not more species of fig?
            
            
              Scope
              Here, we critically review the literature relating to diversification in Ficus, while presenting a synthetic overview of our current understanding and knowledge gaps. We illustrate key concepts with well-studied groups of Ficus and other obligate mutualisms. Our review is unapologetically detailed and includes extensive botanical insight that is frequently overlooked in the literature. We draw on these details to develop hypotheses relating to the origin of diversity within the genus Ficus.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We argue that the fig itself represents a new niche and explore the implications of sexual and vegetative traits in driving diversification (species richness) and diversity (in the ecological sense). An increasingly stable backbone phylogeny and the availability of genomic nuclear and chloroplast data have shed dappled light upon the deep evolutionary past. Incidences of potential diversification through introgression exist, but we must be cautious because the tools used were not always suitable for revealing ancient hybridization. An asymmetric genetic sampling of figs and wasps has further influenced our concepts of host specificity in the genus. Our comparative approach evaluates classical models of speciation in Ficus, concluding that adaptive radiations on islands have triggered diversification. We should maintain global research networks and sample widely. It is tempting to overgeneralize results. This leads to misconceptions and missing puzzle pieces. Furthermore, adoption of standard protocols ensures connectivity.},

To test this, circulating {MPs} were analyzed using flow cytometry and proteomics. Murine and human platelet-depleted plasma showed a cluster of {MPs} positive for the mitochondrial probe {MitoTracker}.

Circulating mitochondria were able to enter rho-zero cells, and were visualized using immunoelectron microscopic imaging.

Considering the breadth of their responsibilities, mitochondria are fundamental for cellular metabolism and homeostasis.

In this review, we provide a detailed overview of mitochondrial metabolism, cellular bioenergetics, mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy, mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns, mitochondria-mediated cell death pathways, and how mitochondrial dysfunction at any of these levels is associated with disease pathogenesis.

Here, we use multiple approaches to define the most likely living relatives of the ancestral bacteria from which mitochondria originated. These bacteria live in marine environments and exhibit the highest frequency of aerobic traits and genes for the metabolism of fundamental lipids that are present in the membranes of eukaryotes, sphingolipids, and cardiolipin.

Despite being essential to the survival of the cell, several mechanistic aspects of ribosome recycling remain unclear. In eubacteria and mitochondria, recycling of the ribosome into subunits requires the concerted action of the ribosome recycling factor ({RRF}) and elongation factor G ({EF}-G). Recently, the conserved protein {HflX} was identified in bacteria as an alternative factor that recycles the ribosome under stress growth conditions. The homologue of {HflX}, the {GTP}-binding protein 6 ({GTPBP}6), has a dual role in mitochondrial translation by facilitating ribosome recycling and biogenesis.

              Sequences and structural attributes of mitochondrial genomes have played a critical role in the clarification of relationships among Cnidaria, a key phylum of early-diverging animals. Among the major lineages of Cnidaria, Ceriantharia (“tube anemones”) remains one of the most enigmatic in terms of its phylogenetic position. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two ceriantharians to see whether the complete organellar genome would provide more support for the phylogenetic placement of Ceriantharia. For both
              Isarachnanthus nocturnus
              and
              Pachycerianthus magnus
              , the mitochondrial gene sequences could not be assembled into a single circular genome. Instead, our analyses suggest that both species have mitochondrial genomes consisting of multiple linear fragments. Linear mitogenomes are characteristic of members of Medusozoa, one of the major lineages of Cnidaria, but are unreported for Anthozoa, which includes the Ceriantharia. The inferred number of fragments and variation in gene order between species is much greater within Ceriantharia than among the lineages of Medusozoa. We identify origins of replication for each of the five putative chromosomes of the
              Isarachnanthus nocturnus
              mitogenome and for each of the eight putative chromosomes of the
              Pachycerianthus magnus
              mitogenome. At 80,923 bp,
              I. nocturnus
              now holds the record for the largest animal mitochondrial genome reported to date. The novelty of the mitogenomic structure in Ceriantharia highlights the distinctiveness of this lineage but, because it appears to be both unique to and diverse within Ceriantharia, it is uninformative about the phylogenetic position of Ceriantharia relative to other Anthozoa. The presence of {tRNA}
              Met
              and {tRNA}
              Trp
              in both ceriantharian mitogenomes supports a closer relationship between Ceriantharia and Hexacorallia than between Ceriantharia and any other cnidarian lineage, but phylogenetic analysis of the genes contained in the mitogenomes suggests that Ceriantharia is sister to a clade containing Octocorallia + Hexacorallia indicating a possible suppression of {tRNA}
              Trp
              in Octocorallia.},

Molecular genetics diagnosis allows the analysis of {DNA} in several areas such as infectiology, oncology, human genetics and personalized medicine. Knowing that the mitochondrial {DNA} is subject to several mutations which have a direct impact on the metabolism of the mitochondrion leading to many diseases, it is therefore necessary to detect these mutations in the patients involved. To date numerous mitochondrial mutations have been described in humans, permitting confirmation of clinical diagnosis, in addition to a better management of the patients. Therefore, different techniques are employed to study the presence or absence of mitochondrial mutations. However, new mutations are discovered, and to determine if they are the cause of disease, different functional mitochondrial studies are undertaken using transmitochondrial cybrid cells that are constructed by fusion of platelets of the patient that presents the mutation, with rho osteosarcoma cell line. Moreover, the contribution of next generation sequencing allows sequencing of the entire human genome within a single day and should be considered in the diagnosis of mitochondrial mutations.},

Here, we show that mitochondrial {RNAPs} ({mtRNAPs}) cap {RNA} with {NAD}+ and {NADH}, and do so more efficiently than nuclear {RNAPs}. Direct quantitation of {NAD}+- and {NADH}-capped {RNA} demonstrates remarkably high levels of capping in vivo: up to {\textasciitilde}60\% {NAD}+ and {NADH} capping of yeast mitochondrial transcripts, and up to {\textasciitilde}15\% {NAD}+ capping of human mitochondrial transcripts. The capping efficiency is determined by promoter sequence at, and upstream of, the transcription start site and, in yeast and human cells, by intracellular {NAD}+ and {NADH} levels. Our findings indicate {mtRNAPs} serve as both sensors and actuators in coupling cellular metabolism to mitochondrial transcriptional outputs, sensing {NAD}+ and {NADH} levels and adjusting transcriptional outputs accordingly.},
